/*

More Thing To Learn:  (Expert in C language)
- more on data types: define your own types (typedef)
- more on the preprocessor: string concatenation
- more on void*
- static libararies and shared object
- macros
- unions
- fucntion pointer (big topic)
- advanced pointers (pointers to pointers)
- variable arguments to function (variadic functions)
- dynamic linking (dlm_open)
- signals, forking and inter-process communication
- threading and concurrency (time of executing code lines)
- sockets (connection to other computers)
- setjump and longjump for restoring state
- more on memory managment and fragmantation
- more on making your program portable
- interfacing with kernel modules (drivers and ioctls)
- more on compiler and linker flags
- advanced use on debagger (gdb)
- profiling and tracing tools (gprof, dtrace, strace)
- memory debuging tools such as valgrid



Summery of the course:
- Basic Operators: logical, arithmetic and assignment
- Conditional Statements: making decisions(if, switch)
- Repeating code: looping (for, while, do-while)
- Arrays: defining and initializing, multi-dimensional
- Functions: declaration and use, arguments and parameters, call by value vs. call by reference
- Debugging: call stack, mistakes, understanding compiler messages
- Structs: initialazing, nested structures
- Character Strings: basics, arrays of chars, character operations
THE MOST IMPORTENT SUBJECT IN C: POINTERS
- Pointers: definition and use, using with functions and arrays, malloc, pointer arithmetic
- Preprocessor: #define, #include
- Input and Output: command line arguments, scanf, printf
- File Input/Output: reaing and writing to a file, fgets, fputs, fgetc, fseek, etc.
- Standard C Library: string functions, math functions, utility functions, standard header files
